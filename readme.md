## Getting started

This repository contains:

- [**Integrations**](#integrations) â€“ all public integrations on the [Botpress Hub](https://app.botpress.cloud/hub)
- [**Agents**](#agents) â€“ all public agents on the [Botpress Studio](https://studio.botpress.cloud) **(coming soon)**
- [**Devtools**](#devtools) â€“ all Botpress Cloud dev tools (CLI, SDK, API Client)

## Integrations

The [`/integrations`](./integrations) folder contains all our public and open-source integrations. We invite the community to contribute their own integrations to Botpress Cloud.

Create integrations using the **Botpress CLI** and submit a pull request to make your mark on the future of chatbots.

### Installation

The Botpress Cloud environment is built using **Typescript** and [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org).
Make sure you have a recent version of Node (>16) and npm installed.

```sh
npm install -g @botpress/cli # for npm
yarn global add @botpress/cli # for yarn
pnpm i -g @botpress/cli # for pnpm
```

### Usage

```sh
# Login for the first time
bp login

# Interactive command to build a new integration
bp init
```

### Deploying a Private Integration

By default, all integrations are private to the workspace they have been deployed in.

```sh
bp deploy
```

### Making your Integration Public

To submit your integration to the Botpress Hub and make it publicly available to the community, please make a pull request to this repository by following these [Integration Contribution guidelines](./integrations).
